## Code Explanation

### Main Functions

- **fetchGitHubActivity(username)**: Fetches the recent activity of the specified GitHub user.

  - Makes an HTTPS GET request to the GitHub API.
  - Handles different response statuses (e.g., 404 for user not found).
  - Parses the JSON response and calls `displayActivity` to format and display the events.

- **displayActivity(events, chalk)**: Displays the fetched activity.

  - Iterates through the events and formats them based on their type.
  - Uses `chalk` to color-code the output for better readability.

- **main()**: The entry point of the application.
  - Parses command-line arguments to get the GitHub username.
  - Calls `fetchGitHubActivity` with the specified username.

### Error Handling

- Handles errors such as user not found (404) and other request failures (status code not OK).
- Uses `chalk` to display error messages in red.
